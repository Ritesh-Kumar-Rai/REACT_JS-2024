# In the Form 
when we use value attribute in a input tag in that case we are unable to write anything else, to do that we need to do Two-Way Binding with the help of
onChange attribute.

## What is Two-way Binding in React
Two-way Binding is a Bi-directional flow of data between UI (e.g Input field) and State (e.g useState() variables).

or 

It is a Synchronization of data between the State and User Interface (UI).

example : When user type something in input type at the same time whatever user typed you are storing that text to State variable or same time you gonna preview that one on user side else.
