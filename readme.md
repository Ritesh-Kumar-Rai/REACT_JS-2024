# REACT JS 


When you work with websites then use REACT ---------> with -----------> REACT_DOM

If you are going to build android applications then use REACT -----------> with ------------> REACT_NATIVE 

# Difference between React, React DOM, and React Native. Let me explain it briefly:

React : is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It is platform-agnostic, which means it can be used for web, mobile, or desktop applications.

React DOM : is a React library that allows you to use React to build web applications and websites. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and styling, and renders your React components into the browserâ€™s DOM (Document Object Model).

React Native : is a React framework that allows you to use React to build native mobile applications for Android and iOS. It uses native UI components and APIs to create cross-platform mobile applications.


### So, when you work with websites, you use React with React DOM. When you build Android applications, you use React with React Native. You can also use React Native for iOS applications, or use React with other libraries or frameworks for desktop applications
