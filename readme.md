# REACT JS 


When you work with websites then use REACT ---------> with -----------> REACT_DOM

If you are going to build android applications then use REACT -----------> with ------------> REACT_NATIVE 

# Difference between React, React DOM, and React Native. Let me explain it briefly:

React : is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It is platform-agnostic, which means it can be used for web, mobile, or desktop applications.

React DOM : is a React library that allows you to use React to build web applications and websites. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and styling, and renders your React components into the browserâ€™s DOM (Document Object Model).

React Native : is a React framework that allows you to use React to build native mobile applications for Android and iOS. It uses native UI components and APIs to create cross-platform mobile applications.


### So, when you work with websites, you use React with React DOM. When you build Android applications, you use React with React Native. You can also use React Native for iOS applications, or use React with other libraries or frameworks for desktop applications


## When we work with React and Vite-React

React : In React you will not get any error but the app will not run until, you put a Component function name As CamelCase[must starts with Capital letter],
        the extension will .js or .jsx (doesn't matter) but Component name and it's Function name must starts with capital letter like : Footer.js , Sidebar.jsx etc.

Vite-React : When you are creating a Component then must use .jsx as extension for components that going to render in webpage.
            And the Component Name must starts with Capital letter like : Navbar.jsx + the function which returns html tags will also must have name starts
            with Capital letter. Unless the vite will show an error
